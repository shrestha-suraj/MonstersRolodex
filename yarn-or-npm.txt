yarn and npm both are good when it comes to managing packages. Yarn was developed by facebook when npm had some
issues with their package manager. But there are some minor things that needs to be considered when it comes to
picking one of these package manager.

UPDATING PACKAGES
-----------------
Command: npm list package_name    where package_name can be react, react-dom, react-scripts and others
         yarn list package_name

If our packages are outdated then we can simply update it by adding ^ to the verison number in dependencies of
of package.json file. After that we can run yarn install or npm update to install all the updated packages.
This is same when it comes to yarn and npm. The difference arrises on fixing the vulnerabilities.

When you use an app and it has vulnerabilities, it means that some package that your packages or your project is
dependent upon has security issues. Hence, we need to update those packages as well. Now in npm we have this command
called "npm audit fix" that tries to find the package creating vulnerability package and update it. But, yarn doesnot
have this command. You can audit the problem by running "yarn audit" but we have to go and manually fix the verison
number for the package.
