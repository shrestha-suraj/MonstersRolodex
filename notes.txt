package.json
------------
->  Dependencies holds the information about the porject dependent files that can be installed
    with npm install command.
->  devDependencies holds the information about the project dependent files for development 
    purpose only. When built version is released, react doesnot download dependencies for this
    file.
->  scripts holds all the running commands for the react project.
    React hides everything behind the scence such that we can easily develop and deploy apps.
    scripts
    -------
    start:  This script allows us to start the project in development mode and load it in the
            live server. Usually, the preferred port is 3000.
    build:  This script is to create optimized production built of our code using Babel and Webpack. The 
            code is compressed in like a min.js file. All css, js are compressed.
            This creates a build folder in our application which is the one that needs to be deployed.
    test:   This is used to test codes for our project.
    eject:  This script is responside for ejecting all the underlying codebase of react such that
            we can edit the core development files like babel and webpack.
            There are developers getting paid to make the babel, webpack as better as possible.
            Hence, ejecting the app and trying to work on it is not recommended.

babel and webpack
-----------------
->  Babel makes sure that all our React code runs on the browser with no errors.
->  Babel is a program that allows our js code to be backward compatible.
        Thus, if an old browser or muliple browsers want to run our js file. Balel makes it possible.

->  Webpack is a module bundler. It allows us to write modular code.
->  It manages our code so that we have to only worry about developing javascript codes while webpack
    manages the folder structure
->  React has a team of highly skilled developers who develop and update this files for us.

import React from 'react';
--------------------------
->  When we import React to the project, the file is immediately identified as a jax file.
->  React module allows us to write html like syntax in javascript file.
->  And the framework understands this beacuse of the React module of react library.

import ReactDOM from 'react';
ReactDOM.render(<App/>,document.getElementById("root"));
--------------------------------------------------------
->  The little robot from our previous lecture.
->  The codebase that modifies the DOM for us. (This robot is different for different frameworks.)
->  It takes the components from App and then injects the code to the "root" div of index.html

Q:  Why do we need unique key for the each component we return from a map function in JSX?
=>  React needs to know what element it needs to update if any of the elements change on the state.
    This makes React smart enough to re-render only the first component rather than the whole map
    elements used in the JSX by identifying the one component to change out of many with similar data.


import {Component} from 'react'
class App extends Component: What is this Component?
----------------------------------------------------
->  extends me to acquire properties of the parent
->  App is saying: Hey, I want all the functionality of this Component class and add my methods as well.
->  Compnents already have some important methods on them. The render() method is also part of the Component
    we override it with our method data.
->  Besides this the Component also provides important variables and methods like: state and componentDidMount


(Life Cycle methods)
------------------
->  Methods that are called at different stages when the included component is rendered.
$ componentDidMount-> is executed after the first render only on the client side. 
                      This is where AJAX requests and DOM or state updates should occur. 
$ componentWillMount-> is executed before rendering, on both the server and the client side.
$ componentWillReceiveProps-> is invoked as soon as the props are updated before another render is called.
$ shouldComponentUpdate-> returns true or false value. This will determine if the component will be updated or not. 
                          This is set to true by default. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render 
                          after state or props are updated, you can return false value.
$ componentWillUpdate-> is called just before rendering (This happens just on the client side)
                        This is triggered by state or pros change and calls this method before re-rendering            
$ componentDidUpdate -> is called just after rendering.
$ componentWillUnmount-> is called after the component is unmounted from the dom. We are unmounting our component in main.js.

-------------------------------------------Key Points----------------------------------------------
#   JSX is JavaScript Expression
#   React is based on unidirectional data flow and hence we use setState() method to set the state
    without modifying it directly which is a security issue as well as violation of unidirectional.
#   When state changes, the component is re-rendered.
#   React uses lego block development approach where the UI is divided into multiple small reusable
    components.
#   JSON data for practice: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
#   JSON data form images: https://robohash.org/N?set=set2?size=AxA  here N is changing number any random
                                                                     A is size value ex: 180x180
#   React allows the development of single page application. This means whenever we request the website
    from the backend. We get the whole React app. Then if we perform events like click an anchor tag for
    different page, the only thing happening is that ReactDOM is manipulation our browser DOM without
    talking to the backend. This made a way for frontend to only talk with backend when data is required.
    Hence, the trend of RESTful API is used as now it doesnot mean we need to get data from only our server.
    We can get data from other servers too for development purpose.

#   jsx and js files are same. It is just naming preferance. If there is Javascript expression involved
    in a component, name it jsx. This will remove confusion from any js file that has simple logics like
    API calls and stuffs.
    Also have package type namimg convention.
    Example: If there is (card.jsx and card.css name them: card.component.jsx and card.styles.css)

--------------------------------------REACT CODE NOTES----------------------------------------------------

# <Header name="test">Nepal</Header>   => accessing props.childern gives Nepal
# componentDidMount(){}  Example of a LifeCycle Method
# onClick(), onChange(), etc. are called SyntheticEvent. They are JSX.
  SyntheticEvent is a fake DOM event, that stops the actual event and tells the JSX
  that something changed on the DOM such that appropriate functionality can be accessed
# const {monsters,searchField}=this.state;
  This is similar to: const monster=this.state.monster and const searchField=this.state.searchField
# filter() method returns each object if the function reutnr true
  includes() method check if the provided data includes the parts sent as parameters
# Regular function has its own context and hence it requires to bind (this) when calling
  any variables of Component level; where as arrow function allows this to be the context of
  the Component level and doesnot have to bind this in the constructor.

# If we ran into error with no-cors issue, we can always use proxy url to bypass that issue and make calls.
Example:
	const proxyurl = "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/"
    	const url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
    	fetch(proxyurl+url).then(******)
