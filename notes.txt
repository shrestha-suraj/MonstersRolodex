package.json
------------
->  Dependencies holds the information about the porject dependent files that can be installed
    with npm install command.
->  devDependencies holds the information about the project dependent files for development 
    purpose only. When built version is released, react doesnot download dependencies for this
    file.
->  scripts holds all the running commands for the react project.
    React hides everything behind the scence such that we can easily develop and deploy apps.
    scripts
    -------
    start:  This script allows us to start the project in development mode and load it in the
            live server. Usually, the preferred port is 3000.
    build:  This script is to create optimized production built of our code using Babel and Webpack. The 
            code is compressed in like a min.js file. All css, js are compressed.
            This creates a build folder in our application which is the one that needs to be deployed.
    test:   This is used to test codes for our project.
    eject:  This script is responside for ejecting all the underlying codebase of react such that
            we can edit the core development files like babel and webpack.
            There are developers getting paid to make the babel, webpack as better as possible.
            Hence, ejecting the app and trying to work on it is not recommended.

babel and webpack
-----------------
->  Babel makes sure that all our React code runs on the browser with no errors.
->  Webpack is a module bundler. It allows us to write modular code.
-> React has a team of highly skilled developers who develop and update this files for us.

import React from 'react';
--------------------------
->  React allows us to write html like syntax in javascript file.
-> And the framework understands this beacuse of the React module of react library.

import ReactDOM from 'react';
ReactDOM.render(<App/>,document.getElementById("root"));
----------------------------
->  The little robot from our previous lecture.
->  The codebase that modifies the DOM for us. (This robot is different for different frameworks.)
->  It takes the components from App and then injects the code to the "root" div of index.html
